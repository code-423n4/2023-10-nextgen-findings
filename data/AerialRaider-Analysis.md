I went over all of the "Never to broken" statements.  Listed my findings in order. 

Properties that should NEVER be broken under any circumstance:
Admin roles can only be registered on the Admin Contract.
Global Admins can only be registered by the Admin Contract owner.
Function and Collection admins can only be registered by global admins.
Specific admin roles can call the functions of the smart contracts.
Only artists can sign their collections.
NFTDelegation is the only delegation management contract that will be used.
Payments can only be made when royalties are set, the artist proposes addresses and percentages, and an admin approves them.(not completed)
Once a hash is set for a specific token it cannot be altered.
The emergencyWithdraw() function sends the funds to the admin contract owner.
Once a collection is frozen (locked) its data cannot be altered.
Airdrop/mint can only be done from the Minter contract.
The random hash is calculated from a Randomizer contract. (no solution proposed) 
The highest bidder will receive the token after an auction finishes, the owner of the token will receive the funds and all other participants will get refunded.



Admin roles can only be registered on the Admin Contract.

NextGenAdmins.sol it seems to be well-structured, to ensure that only admin roles can be registered on this contract.  AdminRequired modifier restricts access to certain functions. However, you need to make sure that this contract is indeed the Admin Contract. You can do this by modifying the constructor to check if the caller is the owner and that the contract hasn't already been set as an Admin Contract.

Here's a modified version of your contract to ensure that only the owner can set it as an Admin Contract:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

/**
 *
 *  @title: NextGen Admin Contract
 *  @date: 26-September-2023 
 *  @version: 1.1
 *  @author: 6529 team
 */

pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import "./Ownable.sol";

contract NextGenAdmins is Ownable {
    // sets global admins
    mapping(address => bool) public adminPermissions;

    // sets collection admins
    mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => bool)) private collectionAdmin;

    // sets permission on specific function
    mapping(address => mapping(bytes4 => bool)) private functionAdmin;

    bool public isAdminContract = false;

    constructor() {
        // Ensure the caller is the owner before setting this contract as an Admin Contract.
        require(_msgSender() == owner(), "Only the owner can set this contract as an Admin Contract");
        isAdminContract = true;
    }

    // certain functions can only be called by an admin
    modifier AdminRequired {
        require(adminPermissions[msg.sender] || (_msgSender() == owner()), "Not allowed");
        _;
    }

    // rest of your contract...
    // ...
    
}

In this modified version, the constructor now checks if the caller is the owner before setting the contract as an Admin Contract. This way, only the owner can designate this contract as the Admin Contract.


Global Admins can only be registered by the Admin Contract owner. (NextGenAdmins.sol)


To ensure that the Global Admins can only be registered by the Admin Contract owner, you should modify the registerAdmin function to include a check that only allows the owner to register global admins. Here's the modified function for NextGenAdmins.sol:

// function to register a global admin
function registerAdmin(address _admin, bool _status) public onlyOwner {
    // Ensure that only the owner can register global admins.
    adminPermissions[_admin] = _status;
}

With this modification, only the owner of the Admin Contract can register global admins using the registerAdmin function, ensuring that global admins can only be registered by the owner.



Function and Collection admins can only be registered by global admins. (NextGenAdmins.sol)



To ensure that the Function Admins and Collection Admins can only be registered by Global Admins, you need to add additional access control checks to the registerFunctionAdmin and registerCollectionAdmin functions. Here's the modified NextGenAdmins.sol code with these checks:

// function to register function admin
function registerFunctionAdmin(address _address, bytes4 _selector, bool _status) public AdminRequired {
    // Ensure that only Global Admins can register function admins.
    require(adminPermissions[msg.sender], "Only Global Admins can register function admins");
    functionAdmin[_address][_selector] = _status;
}

// function to register batch functions admin
function registerBatchFunctionAdmin(address _address, bytes4[] memory _selectors, bool _status) public AdminRequired {
    // Ensure that only Global Admins can register function admins.
    require(adminPermissions[msg.sender], "Only Global Admins can register function admins");
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _selectors.length; i++) {
        functionAdmin[_address][_selectors[i]] = _status;
    }
}

// function to register a collection admin
function registerCollectionAdmin(uint256 _collectionID, address _address, bool _status) public AdminRequired {
    // Ensure that only Global Admins can register collection admins.
    require(adminPermissions[msg.sender], "Only Global Admins can register collection admins");
    require(_collectionID > 0, "Collection Id must be larger than 0");
    collectionAdmin[_address][_collectionID] = _status;
}

With these modifications, only Global Admins can register Function Admins and Collection Admins, as they are required to have the adminPermissions[msg.sender] check in these functions. This ensures that these admin roles can only be registered by Global Admins.


Specific admin roles can call the functions of the smart contracts.(NextGenAdmins.sol)

To allow specific admin roles to call the functions of the smart contract, you can create additional modifiers for each type of admin (e.g., FunctionAdmin and CollectionAdmin) and use them in the functions that should be accessible only by these admin roles. Here's the modified the NextGenAdmins.sol code: 
// Modifier for Function Admins
modifier FunctionAdmin {
    require(functionAdmin[msg.sender][bytes4(keccak256(msg.data))] || adminPermissions[msg.sender], "Not allowed");
    _;
}

// Modifier for Collection Admins
modifier CollectionAdmin(uint256 _collectionID) {
    require(collectionAdmin[msg.sender][_collectionID] || adminPermissions[msg.sender], "Not allowed");
    _;
}

// function to register function admin
function registerFunctionAdmin(address _address, bytes4 _selector, bool _status) public AdminRequired {
    // Ensure that only Global Admins can register function admins.
    require(adminPermissions[msg.sender], "Only Global Admins can register function admins");
    functionAdmin[_address][_selector] = _status;
}

// function to register a collection admin
function registerCollectionAdmin(uint256 _collectionID, address _address, bool _status) public AdminRequired {
    // Ensure that only Global Admins can register collection admins.
    require(adminPermissions[msg.sender], "Only Global Admins can register collection admins");
    require(_collectionID > 0, "Collection Id must be larger than 0");
    collectionAdmin[_address][_collectionID] = _status;
}

// Example function that can only be called by Function Admins
function someFunctionForFunctionAdmins() public FunctionAdmin {
    // Function logic here
}

// Example function that can only be called by Collection Admins for a specific collection
function someFunctionForCollectionAdmin(uint256 _collectionID) public CollectionAdmin(_collectionID) {
    // Function logic here
}

With these modifications, you've created two new modifiers: FunctionAdmin and CollectionAdmin, which check whether the caller has the necessary admin roles to access certain functions. You can apply these modifiers to the relevant functions to control access based on admin roles.


Only artists can sign their collections. (NextGenAdmins.sol)

To ensure that only artists can sign their collections, you can create a modifier that checks if the caller is the artist of the collection and apply this modifier to the function that allows signing collections. Here's a modified version of yourNextGenAdmins.sol  contract:

// Modifier for artists
modifier OnlyArtist(uint256 _collectionID) {
    require(msg.sender == collectionToArtist[_collectionID], "Only the artist can sign this collection");
    _;
}

// Function to register a collection admin
function registerCollectionAdmin(uint256 _collectionID, address _address, bool _status) public AdminRequired {
    // Ensure that only Global Admins can register collection admins.
    require(adminPermissions[msg.sender], "Only Global Admins can register collection admins");
    require(_collectionID > 0, "Collection Id must be larger than 0");
    collectionAdmin[_address][_collectionID] = _status;
}

// Function for artists to sign their collections
function signCollection(uint256 _collectionID) public OnlyArtist(_collectionID) {
    // Only the artist of the collection can sign it.
    collectionSigned[_collectionID] = true;
    emit CollectionSigned(_collectionID, msg.sender);
}

// Event to log collection signing
event CollectionSigned(uint256 indexed collectionID, address indexed artist);

// Example function that can only be called by the artist
function doSomethingWithCollection(uint256 _collectionID) public OnlyArtist(_collectionID) {
    // Function logic here
}

In this modified code:
The OnlyArtist modifier checks whether the caller (msg.sender) is the artist of the specified collection.
The signCollection function can only be called by the artist of the collection, and it sets the collectionSigned state variable to true to indicate that the collection has been signed by the artist.
An event CollectionSigned is emitted to log the signing of the collection.
You can apply the OnlyArtist modifier to other functions that should only be callable by the artist of the collection.



NFTDelegation is the only delegation management contract that will be used. (NextGenRandomizerNXT.sol)


To ensure that NFTDelegation is the only delegation management contract that will be used in the provided code, you can modify the FunctionAdminRequired modifier to check for the specific delegation contract address (NFTDelegation). Here's the modified NextGenRandomizerNXT.sol  code:
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

/**
 *
 *  @title: NextGen Randomizer Contract
 *  @date: 18-October-2023 
 *  @version: 1.4
 *  @author: 6529 team
 */

pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import "./IXRandoms.sol";
import "./INextGenAdmins.sol";
import "./Ownable.sol";
import "./INextGenCore.sol";
import "./NFTDelegation.sol"; // Import NFTDelegation contract

contract NextGenRandomizerNXT {

    IXRandoms public randoms;
    INextGenAdmins private adminsContract;
    INextGenCore public gencoreContract;
    address gencore;

    NFTDelegation public delegationContract; // Declare NFTDelegation contract

    constructor(address _randoms, address _admin, address _gencore, address _delegation) {
        randoms = IXRandoms(_randoms);
        adminsContract = INextGenAdmins(_admin);
        gencore = _gencore;
        gencoreContract = INextGenCore(_gencore);
        delegationContract = NFTDelegation(_delegation); // Set the NFTDelegation contract
    }

    // certain functions can only be called by a global or function admin

    modifier FunctionAdminRequired(bytes4 _selector) {
      require(delegationContract == NFTDelegation(msg.sender) && delegationContract.isValidDelegation(), "Not allowed"); // Check if the sender is the NFTDelegation contract
      _;
    }

    // update contracts if needed

    function updateRandomsContract(address _randoms) public FunctionAdminRequired(this.updateRandomsContract.selector) {
        randoms = IXRandoms(_randoms);
    }

    function updateAdminsContract(address _admin) public FunctionAdminRequired(this.updateAdminsContract.selector) {
        adminsContract = INextGenAdmins(_admin);
    }

    function updateCoreContract(address _gencore) public FunctionAdminRequired(this.updateCoreContract.selector) { 
        gencore = _gencore;
        gencoreContract = INextGenCore(_gencore);
    }

    // function that calculates the random hash and returns it to the gencore contract
    function calculateTokenHash(uint256 _collectionID, uint256 _mintIndex, uint256 _saltfun_o) public {
        require(msg.sender == gencore);
        bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_mintIndex, blockhash(block.number - 1), randoms.randomNumber(), randoms.randomWord()));
        gencoreContract.setTokenHash(_collectionID, _mintIndex, hash);
    }

    // get randomizer contract status
    function isRandomizerContract() external view returns (bool) {
        return true;
    }
    
}

In this modified code, the NFTDelegation contract is imported, and an instance of it is declared in the contract. The FunctionAdminRequired modifier is also modified to ensure that only the NFTDelegation contract can call the functions, and it checks whether the sender is a valid delegation. This modification ensures that only the specified delegation management contract (NFTDelegation) can interact with this contract.


Once a hash is set for a specific token it cannot be altered.


To ensure that once a hash is set for a specific token, it cannot be altered. To achieve this, here are some considerations and suggestions:
Access Control: You are already using access control through the FunctionAdminRequired modifier. This restricts certain functions to be called only by authorized admins.
Authorization Check: When setting the hash value in the calculateTokenHash function, you are checking if the sender is gencore. This ensures that only the gencore contract can set the hash value.
Event Logging: You can consider logging events for all changes in the token hash. This way, you can keep a public record of all hash updates, and users can verify the historical changes
.
Here's an updated example version of the contract that includes event logging:
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

contract NextGenRandomizerNXT is Ownable {
    // ... (Other contract imports and variables)

    event TokenHashUpdated(uint256 collectionID, uint256 mintIndex, bytes32 hash);

    // ... (Constructor and update functions)

    // function that calculates the random hash and returns it to the gencore contract
    function calculateTokenHash(uint256 _collectionID, uint256 _mintIndex, uint256 _saltfun_o) public onlyOwner {
        bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_mintIndex, blockhash(block.number - 1), randoms.randomNumber(), randoms.randomWord()));
        gencoreContract.setTokenHash(_collectionID, _mintIndex, hash);
        emit TokenHashUpdated(_collectionID, _mintIndex, hash);
    }

    // ... (Rest of the contract)
}

With this approach, every time the token hash is updated, an event TokenHashUpdated is emitted. This event will provide a public log of changes, and it will be impossible to alter historical hash values once they have been logged.

Once a hash is set for a specific token it cannot be altered.(2)

RandomizerVRF.sol
The current code indicates that the random hash is generated by the Randomizer contract when calculateTokenHash is called, and it is then set in the Core contract using gencoreContract.setTokenHash. This ensures that the hash is set directly from the Randomizer contract and not by external actors.
In summary, the code appears to follow good practices for ensuring the integrity of token hashes, and the provided access control and event logging mechanisms enhance security and transparency. 

The emergencyWithdraw() function sends the funds to the admin contract owner.

To ensure that the emergencyWithdraw function sends the funds to the admin contract owner, you need to make a small change to the function. You should directly transfer the balance to the admin's address instead of calling the admin's address as a function.
Here's the modified emergencyWithdraw function:

// function to withdraw any balance from the smart contract
function emergencyWithdraw() public FunctionAdminRequired(this.emergencyWithdraw.selector) {
    uint balance = address(this).balance;
    address admin = adminsContract.owner();
    payable(admin).transfer(balance);
    emit Withdraw(msg.sender, true, balance);
}

In this updated code, the transfer function is used to directly send the balance to the admin's address. This should be a safer way to handle the transfer of funds in an emergency withdrawal function.

Once a collection is frozen (locked) its data cannot be altered.(NextGenCore.sol)

To ensure that a collection's data cannot be altered once it is frozen, you can add a modifier to the functions that should be restricted after the collection is frozen. Here is a modified version of your smart contract with the necessary modifier:

s

contract NextGenCore is ERC721Enumerable, Ownable, ERC2981 {
    // ...

    // Modifier to check if a collection is not frozen
    modifier CollectionNotFrozen(uint256 _collectionID) {
        require(!collectionFreeze[_collectionID], "Collection is frozen and cannot be altered");
        _;
    }

    // ...

    // function to create a Collection
    function createCollection(string memory _collectionName, string memory _collectionArtist, string memory _collectionDescription, string memory _collectionWebsite, string memory _collectionLicense, string memory _collectionBaseURI, string memory _collectionLibrary, string[] memory _collectionScript) public FunctionAdminRequired(this.createCollection.selector) {
        require(!collectionFreeze[newCollectionIndex], "Collection is frozen and cannot be altered");
        // The rest of your code...
    }

    // Other functions that should not be altered after the collection is frozen
    // ... (e.g., setCollectionData, addRandomizer, artistSignature, and others)

    // ...

    // Function to freeze a collection
    function freezeCollection(uint256 _collectionID) public FunctionAdminRequired(this.freezeCollection.selector) {
        require(isCollectionCreated[_collectionID] == true, "Collection does not exist");
        collectionFreeze[_collectionID] = true;
    }

    // ...

    // Function to set final supply
    function setFinalSupply(uint256 _collectionID) public FunctionAdminRequired(this.setFinalSupply.selector) CollectionNotFrozen(_collectionID) {
        require(block.timestamp > IMinterContract(minterContract).getEndTime(_collectionID) + collectionAdditionalData[_collectionID].setFinalSupplyTimeAfterMint, "Time has not passed");
        collectionAdditionalData[_collectionID].collectionTotalSupply = collectionAdditionalData[_collectionID].collectionCirculationSupply;
        collectionAdditionalData[_collectionID].reservedMaxTokensIndex = (_collectionID * 10000000000) + collectionAdditionalData[_collectionID].collectionTotalSupply - 1;
    }

    // ...

    // Other functions that should not be altered after the collection is frozen
    // ... (e.g., changeMetadataView, changeTokenData, updateImagesAndAttributes, and others)

    // ...
}
I've added the CollectionNotFrozen modifier to the functions that should be restricted after the collection is frozen. This modifier checks if the collection is frozen before allowing the function to proceed. If the collection is frozen, it will prevent any data alterations.


Airdrop/mint can only be done from the Minter contract.(MinterContract.sol)

To ensure that the Airdrop() and mint() functions can only be called from the Minter contract, you can use the onlyOwner modifier from the Ownable contract that your contract inherits from. This will restrict access to only the owner of the contract, which in your case would be the Minter contract.
Here's the modified MinterContract.sol code for both the Airdrop() and mint() functions with the onlyOwner modifier applied:
// ...

// Modifier to restrict access to only the owner (Minter contract)
modifier onlyMinter() {
    require(msg.sender == owner(), "Only the Minter contract can call this function");
    _;
}

// airdrop function
function airDropTokens(address[] memory _recipients, string[] memory _tokenData, uint256[] memory _saltfun_o, uint256 _collectionID, uint256[] memory _numberOfTokens) public onlyMinter {
    // ... (rest of your function)
}

// mint function
function mint(uint256 _collectionID, uint256 _numberOfTokens, uint256 _maxAllowance, string memory _tokenData, address _mintTo, bytes32[] calldata merkleProof, address _delegator, uint256 _saltfun_o) public payable onlyMinter {
    // ... (rest of your function)
}

// ...

By adding the onlyMinter modifier to both functions, only the owner (the Minter contract) will be able to call these functions. Make sure that you deploy the NextGenMinterContract with the Minter contract as the owner to ensure that only the Minter contract can call these functions.



The highest bidder will receive the token after an auction finishes, the owner of the token will receive the funds and all other participants will get refunded.

So maybe I missed something but to ensure that the highest bidder receives the token after an auction finishes, the owner of the token receives the funds, and all other participants get refunded, I believe you need to implement an auction system within your smart contract. Here's a basic outline of how you can structure your contract to support such an auction system: 
Here is an example code: 
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

contract YourAuctionContract {
    address public owner;
    address public highestBidder;
    uint256 public highestBid;

    // Define the token you're auctioning
    IERC721 public token; // Import the IERC721 interface

    mapping(address => uint256) public refunds;

    enum AuctionStatus { Open, Closed }
    AuctionStatus public auctionStatus;

    event AuctionStarted(address tokenAddress);
    event BidPlaced(address bidder, uint256 amount);
    event AuctionEnded(address highestBidder, uint256 highestBid);
    event Refund(address recipient, uint256 amount);

    constructor(address _tokenAddress) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        token = IERC721(_tokenAddress);
        auctionStatus = AuctionStatus.Closed;
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can call this function");
        _;
    }

    function startAuction() external onlyOwner {
        require(auctionStatus == AuctionStatus.Closed, "Auction is already open");
        auctionStatus = AuctionStatus.Open;
        emit AuctionStarted(address(token));
    }

    function placeBid(uint256 amount) external {
        require(auctionStatus == AuctionStatus.Open, "Auction is not open");
        require(amount > highestBid, "Bid must be higher than the current highest bid");

        if (highestBidder != address(0)) {
            // Refund the previous highest bidder
            uint256 previousHighestBid = highestBid;
            address previousHighestBidder = highestBidder;
            refunds[previousHighestBidder] += previousHighestBid;
            emit Refund(previousHighestBidder, previousHighestBid);
        }

        highestBidder = msg.sender;
        highestBid = amount;

        emit BidPlaced(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function endAuction() external onlyOwner {
        require(auctionStatus == AuctionStatus.Open, "Auction is not open");

        auctionStatus = AuctionStatus.Closed;
        // Transfer the token to the highest bidder
        token.transferFrom(owner, highestBidder, tokenId); // Replace 'tokenId' with the actual token ID

        // Transfer the funds to the owner
        owner.transfer(highestBid);

        emit AuctionEnded(highestBidder, highestBid);

        // Refund other bidders
        for (address recipient : bidders) {
            if (recipient != highestBidder) {
                uint256 refundAmount = refunds[recipient];
                refunds[recipient] = 0;
                if (refundAmount > 0) {
                    recipient.transfer(refundAmount);
                    emit Refund(recipient, refundAmount);
                }
            }
        }

        // Reset the auction state
        highestBidder = address(0);
        highestBid = 0;
    }
}
