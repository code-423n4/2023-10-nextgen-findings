# [L-1] Malicious receiver can stop airdropping
The MinterContract allows airdrops. The [airdrop](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/8b518196629faa37eae39736837b24926fd3c07c/smart-contracts/MinterContract.sol#L181-L192) function loops through every recipient and mints him an amount of NFTs. If one of the receivers does not implement the ERC721 **onERC721Received** or implements it to always revert, the whole airdrop will fail. Consider using [Pull over Push](https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/pull_over_push.html)

# [L-2] NFTs minted in the same block will have the same hash preimage excluding the mintIndex
Since an NFTs hash in [*XRandoms.sol*](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/8b518196629faa37eae39736837b24926fd3c07c/smart-contracts/XRandoms.sol#L35-L43) is generated by a mintIndex, block.prevrandao, blockhash and block.number, all NFTs generated in the same block will have the same preimage except for mintIndex. Because mintIndex cannot be the same for 2 tokens, this is a finding of LOW severity.

# [L-3] The last word of the wordList cannot be accessed
The [*XRandoms.getWord*](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/8b518196629faa37eae39736837b24926fd3c07c/smart-contracts/XRandoms.sol#L15-L33) function stores 100 words as strings in an array. It takes an **id** parameter and returns words[id] if the id is 0 and words[id - 1] otherwise.
The function is private, so it can be called only from the same contract. The only place where it is called is the [*XRandoms.randomWord*](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/8b518196629faa37eae39736837b24926fd3c07c/smart-contracts/XRandoms.sol#L40-L43) with a value from 0-99. The last word is at index 99. It can never be accessed because the id is subtracted by 1.


# [NC-1] Organize the files in the main folder
Currently, all files are stored in the root folders. Consider organizing them into different folders. For example, **libs**, **randoms**, **core**

# [NC-2] Format the code
The code is not formatted properly. Consider using a tool that formats it.
