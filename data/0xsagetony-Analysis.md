# Audit Report - NextGen

### Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings

Context was added where it was relevant to aid the judges.

## Approach

This audit focuses on the NextGen protocol, a smart contract platform for creating and managing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with a focus on generative art and innovative use cases. The audit process involved reviewing the NextGen protocol's codebase, documentation, and functionality to identify any issues, vulnerabilities, and recommendations for improvement.

The audit process followed the following steps:

1. Review of NextGen documentation to gain an understanding of the protocol's design and functionality.
2. Detailed examination of the codebase, starting with the NextgenCore contract and then exploring the other components, including NextgenAdmin, NextgenMinter, and Randomizer.
3. Careful evaluation of the code logic, considering the chain of function calls and their intended functionality.
4. Notes were taken throughout the process to document observations, potential attack vectors, and any areas of concern.
5. Any doubts or confusion were clarified by consulting the documentation or seeking assistance from the project's Discord channel.
6. Evaluation of contract logic with a focus on addressing observations and attack vectors in greater depth.

## Architecture recommendations

The audit report includes the following recommendations for the NextGen protocol:

1. **Loop Handling:** Careful attention should be given to loop handling in the functions to mitigate potential DoS attack vectors.
2. **Error Handling:** Error handling could be improved by specifying the contract where an error originates. For example, using error codes like `error auctionDemo__InvalidInput();` would provide clearer feedback.
3. **Ownable Contract:** Ensure that the Ownable contract is consistently used in relevant parts of the codebase for better access control.

## Codebase quality analysis

The audit identified several key observations:

1. **Codebase Quality:** The codebase was found to be promising, but there were instances where it did not strictly follow Solidity best practices, as outlined in the Solidity style guide.
2. **Error Handling:** Inconsistencies were noted in error handling. Improving error handling by specifying the contract where an error originated from would enhance the protocol's transparency and user experience.
3. **Looping:** The protocol's use of loops in various functions raised concerns about potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack vulnerabilities.
4. **Ownable Contract:** The Ownable contract was not used consistently in various parts of the codebase.

## Centralization Risks

The NextGen protocol is centralized in nature, with central control owned by the address that deployed the admin contract. This centralization aspect should be considered when evaluating the project's governance and risk factors.
