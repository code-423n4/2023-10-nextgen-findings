The proposePrimaryAddressesAndPercentages and proposeSecondaryAddressesAndPercentages function have a check for the status:
```
require (collectionArtistPrimaryAddresses[_collectionID].status == false, "Already approved");

require (collectionArtistSecondaryAddresses[_collectionID].status == false, "Already approved");
```
But these checks are useless as the status for collectionArtistPrimaryAddresses and collectionArtistSecondaryAddresses are always false , first the initial value of a bool is always false , and secondary in these functions they are set to false.

// collectionAdditionalData struct declaration

There is a typo in this struct:
collectionAdditonalDataStructure but it should be collectionAdditionalDataStructure
