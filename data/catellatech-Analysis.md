## 5. Systemic and Centralization Risks
> 🚨 Analyze these contracts and these can be the systemic and centralization risks that we consider the most

### In the NextGenAdmins.sol contract:
**Systemic Risks**:
   1. **Dependency on Contract Security**: The ``NextGenAdmins`` contract plays a crucial role in access control and authorization within the NextGen contract ecosystem. There is a systemic risk in relying on the security and proper functioning of this contract. Any vulnerability or exploitation in "NextGenAdmins" could compromise the integrity and security of the entire NextGen contract system.

   2. **Errors in Permission Management**: Errors in the assignment of administrator permissions, whether at the global, function, or collection level, can have a systemic impact on the operation of NextGen contracts. Incorrect permission settings could allow unauthorized actions or restrict access to critical functions.

**Centralization Risks**:
   1. **Centralized Global Administrators**: If a limited number of global administrators have excessive control or if their actions are not adequately supervised, there is a centralization risk in authority and access to critical functions within the system. This could lead to unilateral decisions or abuses of power.

   2. **Risk of Owner Change**: The contract begins with the original owner assigning permissions, posing a risk of owner change. If original owners change, they may significantly modify permissions, affecting the operation and governance of the system.

   3. **Dependency on Owner's Identity**: The identity and intentions of the original owner are critical for permission management and decision-making. Centralization of this identity could be a risk if the reliability and transparency of the owner are compromised.


### In the RandomizerNXT.sol contract: 
**Systemic Risks**:
   1. **Dependency on External Contracts**: The ``RandomizerNXT`` contract relies on external contracts such as "IXRandoms" and "INextGenCore" to obtain random data and manage tokens. The systemic risk lies in the dependence on the integrity and functioning of these external contracts. If any of the external contracts experience a failure or are compromised, it could affect the operation of the ``RandomizerNXT`` contract and the generation of random hashes.

   2. **Updates to External Contracts**: Updates or changes to external contracts can have an impact on the RandomizerNXT contract. Unforeseen updates in external contracts could trigger conflicts and affect the generation of random hashes.

**Centralization Risks**:
   1. **Administrator Control**: The ``RandomizerNXT`` contract grants access and control to administrators who can update external contracts and perform calculations for random hashes. If a limited number of administrators have excessive control or if their actions are not adequately monitored, there is a risk of centralized control that could lead to misuse or unilateral decisions affecting the system's integrity.


### In the RandomizerRNG.sol contract:
**Systemic Risks**:
   1. **Dependency on the ARRng.io Service**: The contract relies on the [ARRng.io](https://www.arrng.io/) service for the generation of random words and, consequently, random hash values. Any failure or interruption in the ARRng.io service could affect the contract's ability to generate random hash values, potentially negatively impacting applications using this contract.

   2. **Pseudorandomness**: The generation of random hash values is based on block operations, such as keccak256 and timestamp. This is considered pseudorandom, as it may not be entirely unpredictable and could be subject to attacks or manipulations if block data is known.

**Centralization Risks**:
   1. **Centralized Control of the ARRng.io Service**: The contract uses the ARRng.io service for generating random words. The availability and operation of this service are beyond the control of the contract and can be considered centralized. Changes or issues with the ARRng.io service can affect the generation of random hash values.

> To mitigate these risks, it is essential to understand the limitations of random hash value generation based on external services and consider additional solutions to ensure the resilience and security of the randomness generation process. It is also crucial to minimize the contract's dependency on centralized services and have a contingency strategy in case of disruptions in the ARRng.io service.

### In the XRandoms.sol contract:
**Systemic Risks**:
   1. **Pseudorandom Number Generation**: The contract generates random numbers based on operations like keccak256 of blockchain data, such as block number and timestamp. This is considered pseudorandom, as it may not be entirely unpredictable and could be subject to attacks or manipulations if these data are known. The security of the random numbers largely depends on the security of the underlying blockchain.

   2. **Potential Predictability**: Random number generation based on block data could be predictable if an attacker has access to information about the blockchain state at the time of the contract call. This could expose it to guesswork attacks.

**Centralization Risks**:
   1. **Centralized Control of the Word List**: The contract maintains a list of predefined words. Updating or modifying this list would require centralized intervention and is not user-controllable. This introduces an element of centralization in the selection of words available for generation.
   The list of predefined words is static and does not allow users to contribute new words or modify the list. This may limit the diversity and customization of the generated words.

> To mitigate these risks, it's essential to understand the limitations of blockchain-based random number generation and consider additional solutions, such as using trusted external oracles or contracts specializing in more secure random number generation. Additionally, consider allowing users to contribute new words or modify the word list to increase system flexibility and decentralization.

### In the AuctionDemo.sol contract:
**Systemic Risks**:
1. **Dependency on Other Contracts**: The contract relies on interactions with other contracts like "IMinterContract," "IERC721," and "INextGenAdmins." Any changes or vulnerabilities in these contracts can affect the functionality and security of "AuctionDemo."

**Centralization Risks**:
1. **Centralized Administration**: The contract depends on the "INextGenAdmins" interface to allow certain actions, such as claiming a won NFT. Centralized administration through this interface could lead to a lack of decentralization and unilateral decision-making.
