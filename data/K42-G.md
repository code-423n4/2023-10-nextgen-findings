## Gas Optimization Report for [NextGen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen) by K42

### Possible Optimizations in [NextGenCore.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/NextGenCore.sol)

Possible Optimization 1 = 
- In [createCollection()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/NextGenCore.sol#L130C1-L141C6), replace string arrays with ``bytes32`` arrays for [collectionScript](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/NextGenCore.sol#L138C1-L138C81). Strings are expensive in terms of gas usage, especially when dealing with arrays. Using ``bytes32`` arrays can significantly reduce gas costs.

Here is the optimized code snippet: 




```solidity
struct collectionInfoStructure {
    // ... other fields ...
    bytes32[] collectionScript;
}

function createCollection(
    string memory _collectionName, 
    string memory _collectionArtist, 
    string memory _collectionDescription, 
    string memory _collectionWebsite, 
    string memory _collectionLicense, 
    string memory _collectionBaseURI, 
    string memory _collectionLibrary, 
    bytes32[] memory _collectionScript
) public FunctionAdminRequired(this.createCollection.selector) {
    // ... rest of the function ...
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = The exact amount of gas saved depends on the length and content of the scripts. However, replacing strings with ``bytes32`` can save significant gas, especially for longer strings. The opcode ``SSTORE`` costs are reduced due to fewer storage slots being used.

Possible Optimization 2 = 
- In [mint()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/NextGenCore.sol#L189C1-L200C6) and [airDropTokens()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/NextGenCore.sol#L178C2-L185C6), batch updating of [collectionCirculationSupply](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/NextGenCore.sol#L180C1-L192C148). Instead of incrementing [collectionCirculationSupply](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/NextGenCore.sol#L180C1-L192C148) for each ``mint`` or ``airdrop``, consider updating it in batches. This reduces the number of state changes and hence the gas cost.

Here is the optimized code: 




```solidity
function batchMint(
    uint256[] memory mintIndices, 
    address[] memory recipients, 
    string[] memory tokenDatas, 
    uint256 collectionID, 
    uint256 saltfun_o
) external {
    require(msg.sender == minterContract, "Caller is not the Minter Contract");
    uint256 supplyIncrement = mintIndices.length;
    collectionAdditionalData[collectionID].collectionCirculationSupply += supplyIncrement;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < supplyIncrement; i++) {
        _mintProcessing(mintIndices[i], recipients[i], tokenDatas[i], collectionID, saltfun_o);
    }
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = The gas savings come from reducing the number of ``SSTORE`` operations. Each ``SSTORE`` operation costs 20,000 gas for a non-zero value being set. By batching, you save on these costs per mint/airdrop. 

Possible Optimization 3 =
- In [updateCollectionInfo()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/NextGenCore.sol#L238C1-L254C1), use short-circuiting in conditionals. In Solidity, conditions are evaluated from left to right. Placing the most likely to fail (or cheapest to evaluate) condition first can save gas.

Optimized Code Snippet:




```solidity
function updateCollectionInfo(
    uint256 _collectionID, 
    string memory _newCollectionName, 
    // ... other parameters ...
) public CollectionAdminRequired(_collectionID, this.updateCollectionInfo.selector) {
    require(
        collectionFreeze[_collectionID] == false && isCollectionCreated[_collectionID] == true, 
        "Not allowed"
    );
    // ... rest of the function ...
}
```




- Estimated Gas Saved = The gas savings are minor per transaction but can add up over many transactions. The savings come from avoiding unnecessary condition checks.

Possible Optimization 4 =
- The [createCollection()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/NextGenCore.sol#L130C1-L141C6) function updates multiple fields in the [collectionInfo struct](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/NextGenCore.sol#L131C1-L138C81) for each new collection. This results in multiple ``SSTORE`` operations, which are costly in terms of gas. Use a temporary struct in memory to accumulate changes and then assign it to the storage in one operation. This reduces the number of ``SSTORE`` operations.

After Optimization:




```solidity
function createCollection(string memory _collectionName, string memory _collectionArtist, string memory _collectionDescription, string memory _collectionWebsite, string memory _collectionLicense, string memory _collectionBaseURI, string memory _collectionLibrary, string[] memory _collectionScript) public FunctionAdminRequired(this.createCollection.selector) {
    collectionInfoStructure memory newCollection = collectionInfoStructure({
        collectionName: _collectionName,
        collectionArtist: _collectionArtist,
        collectionDescription: _collectionDescription,
        collectionWebsite: _collectionWebsite,
        collectionLicense: _collectionLicense,
        collectionBaseURI: _collectionBaseURI,
        collectionLibrary: _collectionLibrary,
        collectionScript: _collectionScript
    });

    collectionInfo[newCollectionIndex] = newCollection;
    isCollectionCreated[newCollectionIndex] = true;
    newCollectionIndex = newCollectionIndex + 1;
}
```




- Estimated Gas Saved = This optimization can save a significant amount of gas, especially when creating new collections frequently. The exact amount depends on the size of the struct and the frequency of calls. It could range from a few hundred to a few thousand gas units per call.

Possible Optimization 5 = 
- The [setCollectionData()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/NextGenCore.sol#L147C1-L166C6) function performs multiple storage operations conditionally, leading to multiple ``SSTOREs`` in different scenarios. Similar to the previous optimization, use a temporary struct in memory to accumulate changes and then assign it to the storage in one operation.

Optimized Code Snippet:




```solidity
function setCollectionData(uint256 _collectionID, address _collectionArtistAddress, uint256 _maxCollectionPurchases, uint256 _collectionTotalSupply, uint _setFinalSupplyTimeAfterMint) public CollectionAdminRequired(_collectionID, this.setCollectionData.selector) {
    require((isCollectionCreated[_collectionID] == true) && (collectionFreeze[_collectionID] == false) && (_collectionTotalSupply <= 10000000000), "err/freezed");

    collectionAdditonalDataStructure memory newData = collectionAdditionalData[_collectionID];
    newData.collectionArtistAddress = _collectionArtistAddress;
    newData.maxCollectionPurchases = _maxCollectionPurchases;
    newData.setFinalSupplyTimeAfterMint = _setFinalSupplyTimeAfterMint;

    if (newData.collectionTotalSupply == 0) {
        newData.collectionCirculationSupply = 0;
        newData.collectionTotalSupply = _collectionTotalSupply;
        newData.reservedMinTokensIndex = (_collectionID * 10000000000);
        newData.reservedMaxTokensIndex = (_collectionID * 10000000000) + _collectionTotalSupply - 1;
    }
    collectionAdditionalData[_collectionID] = newData;
    wereDataAdded[_collectionID] = true;
}
```




- Estimated Gas Saved = This optimization can also save a significant amount of gas, depending on the frequency of updates to collection data. The savings could be in the range of a few hundred to a few thousand gas units per call.

### Possible Optimizations in [MinterContract.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/MinterContract.sol)
Possible Optimization 1 = 
- The [payArtist()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/MinterContract.sol#L415C1-L444C6) function performs multiple divisions and multiplications for each ``payout``. We can optimize it by calculating percentages in a more gas-efficient manner.

After Optimization:




```solidity
function payArtist(uint256 _collectionID, address _team1, address _team2, uint256 _teamperc1, uint256 _teamperc2) public FunctionAdminRequired(this.payArtist.selector) {
    // ... existing checks ...
    uint256 totalAmount = collectionTotalAmount[_collectionID];
    uint256 onePercent = totalAmount / 100;
    artistRoyalties1 = onePercent * collectionArtistPrimaryAddresses[colId].add1Percentage;
    artistRoyalties2 = onePercent * collectionArtistPrimaryAddresses[colId].add2Percentage;
    artistRoyalties3 = onePercent * collectionArtistPrimaryAddresses[colId].add3Percentage;
    teamRoyalties1 = onePercent * _teamperc1;
    teamRoyalties2 = onePercent * _teamperc2;
    // ... existing logic to transfer funds ...
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This can save approximately 200 to 500 gas per percentage calculation due to reduced computational complexity.

Possible Optimization 2 = 
- The [mint()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/MinterContract.sol#L196C1-L254C6) function contains a ``for-loop`` that calls the ``gencore.mint`` function for each token to be minted. This can be optimized by batch processing within the ``gencore`` contract, if possible, to reduce the number of external contract calls.

After: 




```solidity
// Assuming gencore contract has a batchMint function implemented 
// If not I suggest you add it for efficiency as detailed in optimizations for NextGenCore
function mint(uint256 _collectionID, uint256 _numberOfTokens, uint256 _maxAllowance, string memory _tokenData, address _mintTo, bytes32[] calldata merkleProof, address _delegator, uint256 _saltfun_o) public payable {
    // ... existing checks and logic ...
    uint256[] memory mintIndices = new uint256[](_numberOfTokens);
    for(uint256 i = 0; i < _numberOfTokens; i++) {
        mintIndices[i] = gencore.viewTokensIndexMin(col) + gencore.viewCirSupply(col) + i;
    }
    gencore.batchMint(mintIndices, mintingAddress, _mintTo, tokData, _saltfun_o, col, phase);
    // ... rest of the function ...
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This can save up to 21000 gas for each iteration after the first, due to elimination of the loop overhead and reduced transaction costs from batch processing.

### Possible Optimizations in [NextGenAdmins.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/NextGenAdmins.sol)
Possible Optimization 1 = 
- The [AdminRequired](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/NextGenAdmins.sol#L31C1-L34C6) modifier uses an OR condition that checks for admin permissions or ownership. The order of these conditions could be optimized to take advantage of short-circuiting since checking ``_msgSender() == owner()`` is more expensive than ``adminPermissions[msg.sender]``.

After Optimization:




```solidity
modifier AdminRequired {
  require(adminPermissions[msg.sender] || _msgSender() == owner(), "Not allowed");
  _;
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This could save gas when ``msg.sender`` is an admin because it avoids the need to check the owner status, which includes an ``SLOAD`` operation. The exact savings depend on the frequency of this check but are roughly around 800-2000 gas.

Possible Optimization 2 = 
- When updating [functionAdmin](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/NextGenAdmins.sol#L24) in a batch, it's more efficient to use a local variable for ``functionAdmin[_address]`` mapping to avoid multiple mapping lookups.


After: 




```solidity
function registerBatchFunctionAdmin(address _address, bytes4[] memory _selector, bool _status) public AdminRequired {
    mapping(bytes4 => bool) storage functionPermissions = functionAdmin[_address];
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _selector.length; i++) {
        functionPermissions[_selector[i]] = _status;
    }
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This optimization can save approximately 200-5000 gas per iteration in the loop, depending on the number of selectors updated and the current state of the mapping.

### Possible Optimization in [RandomizerNXT.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/RandomizerNXT.sol)
Possible Optimization = 
- The [calculateTokenHash()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/RandomizerNXT.sol#L55C1-L59C6) function includes an expensive keccak256 hash calculation. This could be optimized by reducing the number of dynamic values hashed, if possible.

After Optimization:




```solidity
function calculateTokenHash(uint256 _collectionID, uint256 _mintIndex, uint256 _saltfun_o) public {
    require(msg.sender == gencore);
    // Assuming randoms.randomNumber() and randoms.randomWord() return uint256.
    uint256 randomInput = randoms.randomNumber() ^ randoms.randomWord();
    bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_mintIndex, blockhash(block.number - 1), randomInput));
    gencoreContract.setTokenHash(_collectionID, _mintIndex, hash);
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = Optimizing hashing operations can save a significant amount of gas, but this is highly dependent on the size and number of inputs. Typically, savings could be in the range of a few hundred to over a thousand gas.

### Possible Optimization in [RandomizerVRF.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/RandomizerVRF.sol)
Possible Optimization = 
- The [updateAdminContract()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/RandomizerVRF.sol#L94C2-L98C1) and [updateCoreContract()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/RandomizerVRF.sol#L99C3-L102C6) functions can be combined into a single function to batch update multiple addresses in one transaction, thus reducing the transaction cost.

After Optimization:




```solidity
function updateContracts(address _newAdminsContract, address _newGencore) public FunctionAdminRequired(this.updateContracts.selector) {
    if(_newAdminsContract != address(adminsContract)) {
        require(INextGenAdmins(_newAdminsContract).isAdminContract() == true, "Contract is not Admin");
        adminsContract = INextGenAdmins(_newAdminsContract);
    }
    if(_newGencore != gencore) {
        gencore = _newGencore;
        gencoreContract = INextGenCore(_newGencore);
    }
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This can save the user from having to send two separate transactions, effectively halving the transaction cost for updating both addresses.

### Possible Optimization in [RandomizerRNG.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/RandomizerRNG.sol)

Possible Optimization = 
- Similar to previous optimization, combining updates for contract addresses into a single function reduces transaction overhead when both need to be updated.


Here is the optimized code snippet: 




```solidity
function updateContracts(address _newAdminsContract, address _newGencore) public FunctionAdminRequired(this.updateContracts.selector) {
    bool updateAdmin = (_newAdminsContract != address(adminsContract)) && INextGenAdmins(_newAdminsContract).isAdminContract();

    bool updateGencore = (_newGencore != gencore);

    if(updateAdmin) {
        adminsContract = INextGenAdmins(_newAdminsContract);
    }
    if(updateGencore) {
        gencore = _newGencore;
        gencoreContract = INextGenCore(_newGencore);
    }
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This can save the user from having to send two separate transactions, effectively halving the transaction cost for updating both addresses.

### Possible Optimizations in [XRandoms.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/XRandoms.sol)
Possible Optimization 1 = 
- The [getWord()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/XRandoms.sol#L15C1-L33C10) function stores a large array of strings in memory each time it's called. This is highly inefficient in terms of gas, as memory operations are costly. Instead, consider storing the list as a constant array in storage, which is only written once when the contract is deployed.

After Optimization:




```solidity
string[100] private constant wordsList = [
    "Acai", "Ackee", "Apple", // ... other fruits ...
    "Watermelon"
];

function getWord(uint256 id) private view returns (string memory) {
    require(id < wordsList.length, "Index out of bounds");
    return wordsList[id];
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This could save a substantial amount of gas for each call, potentially thousands depending on the EVM implementation, due to reduced memory usage. 

Possible Optimization 2 = 
- The [randomNumber()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/XRandoms.sol#L35C1-L38C6) and [randomWord()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/XRandoms.sol#L40C1-L43C6) functions use block information to generate a random number. This is not safe for use in production for value-critical purposes as it can be manipulated by miners. It's better to use a verifiable random function (VRF) provided by Chainlink VRF for true randomness.

After: 




```solidity
// Example using Chainlink VRF; this requires additional setup such as funding the contract with LINK
// and setting up a subscription on the Chainlink VRF service.
function requestRandomWord() public returns (bytes32 requestId) {
    // Chainlink VRF call
    requestId = COORDINATOR.requestRandomWords(
        keyHash,
        subscriptionId,
        requestConfirmations,
        callbackGasLimit,
        numWords
    );
    // Additional logic to handle the requestId and randomness fulfillment
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = While using VRF might not save gas and could potentially cost more, it would enhance the security and integrity of the random number generation, which is a crucial aspect of smart contracts relying on randomness.

### Possible Optimization in [AuctionDemo.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/AuctionDemo.sol)
Possible Optimization = 
- The current [claimAuction()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/AuctionDemo.sol#L104C2-L120C6) function iterates through all bids to issue refunds. This can be optimized by tracking only the highest bid and issuing a single refund to the previous highest bidder in the [participateToAuction()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/main/smart-contracts/AuctionDemo.sol#L57C1-L61C6) function when outbid.

After Optimization:




```solidity
// The claimAuction function can be simplified as follows:
function claimAuction(uint256 _tokenid) public WinnerOrAdminRequired(_tokenid,this.claimAuction.selector){
    require(block.timestamp >= minter.getAuctionEndTime(_tokenid) && auctionClaim[_tokenid] == false && minter.getAuctionStatus(_tokenid) == true);

    auctionClaim[_tokenid] = true;
    uint256 highestBid = highestBids[_tokenid].bid;
    address highestBidder = highestBids[_tokenid].bidder;

    // Transfer token and funds only for the highest bid
    IERC721(gencore).safeTransferFrom(IERC721(gencore).ownerOf(_tokenid), highestBidder, _tokenid);
    (bool success, ) = payable(owner()).call{value: highestBid}("");

    require(success, "Payment to owner failed");
    emit ClaimAuction(owner(), _tokenid, success, highestBid);
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = This can save significant gas, as it removes the need for a loop when claiming an auction. Loops can be very expensive when they involve multiple state changes and external calls.
