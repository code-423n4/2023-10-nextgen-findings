### Non-critical findings / Improvements

1. Consider adding comments and descriptions of functions like in GitHub, it makes code easier to understand (e.g. https://seize-io.gitbook.io/nextgen/nextgen-smart-contracts/minter). There is no need to go to GitHub to check what a certain function does and what each param or return value means
2. In AuctionDemo.sol file, the contract's name is written in a mixedCase manner (auctionDemo). Contracts and libraries should be named using the CapWords style. (https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/8b518196629faa37eae39736837b24926fd3c07c/smart-contracts/AuctionDemo.sol#L18)
3. Modifiers should be named mixedCase (overall in code, but here is one example of occurrence where this is not the case: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/8b518196629faa37eae39736837b24926fd3c07c/smart-contracts/NextGenCore.sol#L116-L126)
4. Addresses should not be hardcoded in a constructor or in code, if the address is already known use constants. Especially zero addresses or similar (https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/8b518196629faa37eae39736837b24926fd3c07c/smart-contracts/MinterContract.sol#L205-L207, https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/8b518196629faa37eae39736837b24926fd3c07c/smart-contracts/NextGenCore.sol#L111)
5. Consider renaming these functions for better understanding: `retrieveGlobalAdmin` and `retriveFunctionAdmin`. Both functions return boolean value if the provieded address is global admin, i.e. function admin. Maybe `checkIfGlobalAdmin` and `checkIfFunctionAdmin` would be more appropriate here, otherwise one might think that the address of the global admin or function admin is returned. 
6. Refactor `require` statements to `modifier` if they are used multiple time in code. Example: `require(gencore.retrievewereDataAdded(_collectionID) == true, "Add data")` and `require(setMintingCosts[_collectionID] == true, "Set Minting Costs");` (https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/8b518196629faa37eae39736837b24926fd3c07c/smart-contracts/MinterContract.sol#L171-L197)
7. Use `_collectionID` and `_tokenData` directly instead of assigning it to a local variable (https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/8b518196629faa37eae39736837b24926fd3c07c/smart-contracts/MinterContract.sol#L198-L201)
