The function freezeCollection needs an event emission to notify external listeners that the collection has been frozen. This could be important as it will provide/maintain transparency to users.

```solidity 
    function freezeCollection(uint256 _collectionID) public FunctionAdminRequired(this.freezeCollection.selector) {
        require(isCollectionCreated[_collectionID] == true, "No Col");
        collectionFreeze[_collectionID] = true;
    }

```
An event definition could be added in the following way. 

```solidity 
event CollectionFrozen(uint256 indexed collectionId);

function freezeCollection(uint256 _collectionID) public FunctionAdminRequired(this.freezeCollection.selector) {
    require(isCollectionCreated[_collectionID] == true, "No Col");
    collectionFreeze[_collectionID] = true;
    emit CollectionFrozen(_collectionID);
}
```

As this will emit an event with the CollectionFrozen signature and _collectionId parameter, which can used/tracked by external listeners when collection is frozen
