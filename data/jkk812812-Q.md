## Not well-formed public declaration

In the contracts RandomizerVRF and RandomizerRNG, the function requestRandomWords is declared as public, but it is only used within the contract and is not directly called externally. Consider changing the function declaration from public to internal. This adjustment aligns with best practices, making the function internal and, at the same time, saving gas costs.

## Duplicate verification

In the NextGenCore contract, it seems that the require statement `require(tokenToHash[_mintIndex]==0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000);` in the setTokenHash function may not be necessary. Upon reviewing the code, it appears that _mintIndex is not expected to repeat, so consider removing this check.

File:smart-contracts/NextGenCore.sol

301  require(tokenToHash[_mintIndex] == 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000);

## The contract name is inconsistent with the file name.

The contract name "auctionDemo" should be consistent with the file name "AuctionDemo" to enhance code readability and maintainability.

## Not validating the return value of the `call` function.

In the `MinterContract` contract, the `payArtist` function might have a potential risk. This function uses the `call` method for multiple transfers but does not check whether the transfers are successful. If the artist's address is a contract, it may result in a failed transfer. However, there is no rollback in case of a failed transfer, leading to a loss of funds.

This issue is also present in the `emergencyWithdraw` function. To address this, ensure that the `admin` is not a contract, add a check for the `admin` address, or validate the return results of the `call` function to make the contract more robust and prevent potential vulnerabilities in the future.

Additionally, in the `NextGenRandomizerRNG` contract, the `emergencyWithdraw` function still lacks validation of the `call` function's return value. Meanwhile, functions such as `claimAuction`, `cancelBid`, `cancelAllBids`, etc., in the `auctionDemo` contract perform validation on the return values of `call`. Therefore, it is crucial to pay close attention to validating the return values of `call`, unless you are absolutely certain that `call` invocations will not result in errors.
