Quality Assurance Report
Overview
The quality assurance review of the smart contract system unveiled several critical observations and potential issues that require attention and refinement.

Findings
1. Inconsistent Storage Contract References: The storage contract shows inconsistency in referencing types. This is evident in the declarations of INextGenAdmins private adminsContract; and address public minterContract;.

2. Hardcoded Royalty Percentage: The hardcoding of the royaltyAddress with 69% might pose potential issues due to its static nature. A more flexible and parameterized approach would be advisable.

3. Setting a Fixed maxCollectionSupply: The hardcoded value of 10000000000 for maxCollectionSupply should be assigned as a constant for better maintenance and readability.

4. Minter Contract Security: Consider implementing a modifier that ensures msg.sender must be equal to minterContract for heightened security and controlled access.

5. Unused getTokenName Function: The getTokenName function is marked as private and appears to have no references within the core logic. Its necessity should be reviewed for potential removal or utilization.

6. Lack of Functionality in Admin Contract: The admin contract lacks sufficient functionality to revoke permissions once assigned. Incorporating a mechanism for permission revocation is recommended.

7. Constructor Logic Clarification: The logic behind incrementing the default value (0) in the constructor should be reviewed for its necessity or potential implications.

8. Redundant Declarations in Minter Contract: Line 267 and 281 in the MinterContract repeat the definition of mintIdex. These duplications should be resolved for code cleanliness.

9. Add Modifier for retrieveWereDataAdded: In the Minter contract, a modifier could be added to verify retrieveWereDataAdded as true, enhancing its safety and integrity.

10. Unnecessary Boolean Values: Consider removing the redundant boolean values 'true' at lines 328, 329, and 337 for improved code clarity.

Recommendations
- Review and resolve inconsistencies in referencing types within the storage contract.
- Employ dynamic configurations for the royaltyAddress to enhance flexibility.
- Refactor the contract to replace hardcoded values with constants for better maintainability.
- Enhance security by introducing modifiers to ensure necessary contract interactions.
- Review and optimize the codebase to remove redundant or unused functions/declarations.
- Strengthen the admin contract's functionality by adding revocation mechanisms.
- Reevaluate the constructor's logic and the necessity of default value incrementation.
- Remove duplicate declarations in the MinterContract for cleaner code.
- Implement necessary checks or modifiers to ensure the reliability and integrity of contract interactions.
- Enhance code readability by removing unnecessary boolean values for clearer code understanding.
Conclusion
The outlined findings and recommendations aim to improve the security, maintainability, and clarity of the smart contract system. Addressing these issues will result in a more robust and reliable system that adheres to best practices in smart contract development.
