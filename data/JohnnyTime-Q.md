The function `updateImagesAndAttributes()` in the `NextGenCore.sol` contract takes three arrays as parameters: `_tokenId`, `_images`, and `_attributes`.

It iterates through the _tokenId array, updating the data based on the corresponding values in the `_images` and `_attributes` arrays.

However, a crucial issue arises as there is no check to ensure that the lengths of these three arrays are the same. If the function caller sends an array with 6 tokens, 4 images, and 3 attributes, the tokens won't be updated correctly.

To address this, I recommend adding a check at the beginning of the function, like this:
```solidity
require(_tokenId.length == _images.length && _tokenId.length == _attributes.length, "length mismatch");
```
