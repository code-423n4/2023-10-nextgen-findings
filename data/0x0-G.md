# Gas optimisation findings

## Expensive sale option 3 revert in MinterContract.sol mint function

### Description
In the MinterContract mint function, if the sale has been set to option 3, then an extra check followed by a revert is performed at the end of the function:
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/8b518196629faa37eae39736837b24926fd3c07c/smart-contracts/MinterContract.sol#L239C1-L253C10

This mean, the revert will happen after all the previous checks and mint logic, adding computation and gas consumption until the revert is reached.
In such a case, the transaction sender will no matter what in case of a revert still pay off for the gas used for the checks and mints.

### Suggestion
Consider using early revert pattern here, when possible, consider moving checks and reverts before huge computations or storage writes so the revert will happen before, reducing significantly the reverted transaction cost.

In your situation, I would move this code before the mint loop on line 234, "viewCirSupply" could be computed before to preserve the logic.
note: Considering the number of "viewCirSupply" calls, I would as well suggest caching this value, to spare gas (perform your increment on the cached value instead of calling it into a loop).

## Gas cost of XRandoms.sol's getWord function could be reduced

### Description
In XRandoms's getWord function, you create a "constant" memory array containing 100 elements, this mean that this memory array will actually be recreated at each calls of the getWord function. As a result, ending up costing more gas that it shoud.

### Suggestion
Here if you instead store that array in contract storage during deployment (constructor), you will spare  5168 gas unit for each call of this function.
With optimizer on with 200 runs I get:
existing: execution cost 8566
below: execution cost 3398

```
contract randomPool {
    string[100] words;

    constructor() {
        words = ["Acai", "Ackee", "Apple", "Apricot", "Avocado", "Babaco", "Banana", "Bilberry", "Blackberry", "Blackcurrant", "Blood Orange",

    function getWord(uint256 id) public view returns (string memory) {
        // returns a word based on index
        if (id==0) {
            return words[id];
        } else {
            return words[id - 1];
        }
    }

    function randomNumber() public view returns (uint256){
        uint256 randomNum = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.prevrandao, blockhash(block.number - 1), block.timestamp))) % 1000;
        return randomNum;
    }

    function randomWord() public view returns (string memory) {
        uint256 randomNum = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.prevrandao, blockhash(block.number - 1), block.timestamp))) % 100;
        return getWord(randomNum);
    }

    function returnIndex(uint256 id) public view returns (string memory) {
        return getWord(id);
    }

}
```

## Pack variable when possible

### Description
In AuctionDemo.sol, there is a struct 'auctionInfoStru' which could be packed, but isn't due to its definition:
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/8b518196629faa37eae39736837b24926fd3c07c/smart-contracts/AuctionDemo.sol#L43C1-L48C1

address takes 20 bytes
uint256 takes a full word
bool takes 8 bytes

Ordering structure like this would make address take the full slot, uint256 as well (no changes here), and then a 3rd slot in order to store the boolean.

### Suggestion
Consider ordering the struct like this instead:
```
struct auctionInfoStru {
    address bidder;
    bool status;
    uint256 bid;
}
```

This way variable will be packed (bidder with status), taking only 2 slots instead.
Knowing the fact this structure is stored into a mapping, you will spare off 1 slot per collection.

## Packing variable, going further

### Description
NextGenCore.sol contract is defining several mapping from collections to bool values. As a result, those values when set will take 32 bytes of space no matter what in your contract storage as mapping are only mapping to bool. Taking into account that those are indexed by collection index, isCollectionCreated, wereDataAdded, onchainMetadata, collectionFreeze and artistSigned could end up wasting space while it could have been packed:
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-nextgen/blob/8b518196629faa37eae39736837b24926fd3c07c/smart-contracts/NextGenCore.sol#L61C1-L101C52

### Suggestion
You could consider creating a structure here as well to pack all those boolean values, taking only 1 slot instead of 5 for each collection there will be. Since all of them are indexed by collection index such a code is possible:
```
struct CollectionExtraData {
    bool isCollectionCreated;
    bool wereDataAdded;
    bool onchainMetadata;
    bool collectionFreeze;
    bool artistSigned;
}

mapping(uint256 => CollectionExtraData) private collectionExtraDataMap;
```
