# Expensive sale option 3 revert in MinterContract mint function

## Description
In the MinterContract mint function, if the sale has been set to option 3, then an extra check followed by a revert is performed at the end of the function:

This mean, the revert will happen after all the previous checks and mint logic, adding computation and gas consumption until the revert is reached.
In such a case, the transaction sender will no matter what in case of a revert still pay off for the gas used for the checks and mints.

## Suggestion
Consider using early revert pattern here, when possible, consider moving checks and reverts before huge computations or storage writes so the revert will happen before, reducing significantly the reverted transaction cost.

In your situation, I would move this code before the mint loop on line 234, "viewCirSupply" could be computed before to preserve the logic.
note: Considering the number of "viewCirSupply" calls, I would as well suggest caching this value, to spare gas (perform your increment on the cached value instead of calling it into a loop).
